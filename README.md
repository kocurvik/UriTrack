# UriTrack
Repository for the open-source Android app "UriTrack" for urinary health tracking.

You can find the app on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kocur.tabapp)

## Privacy policy

The developer does not collect nor do they have access to the data you input in the app.

## Disclaimer

This was just a short project and my first apo. The codebase is very messy and does not adhere to any standards. I also have very limited time right now to maintain it.

## Reporting bugs

If find a bug or want to request a feature please create an issue here or email me at `kocurvik@gmail.com` if you do not have a GitHub account.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute feel free to make a PR. I will try to look at it and merge it for a new release. My time for this project is limited.
